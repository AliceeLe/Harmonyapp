This is the app in React which is running at https://harmonydata.ac.uk/app. It is not the blog which is at the base of the https://harmonydata.ac.uk domain at all paths other than /app.

* ü™ß The source code of the Harmony static blog at https://harmonydata.ac.uk is in this repo: https://github.com/harmonydata/harmonydata.github.io. It is hosted with Github Pages.
* ü™ß The Harmony Python library source code is here: https://github.com/harmonydata/harmony.
* ü™ß The Harmony R library source code is here: https://github.com/harmonydata/harmony_r.
* ü™ß The Harmony API source code is here: https://github.com/harmonydata/harmonyapi.

## Installing on your local machine

[YouTube video on installing and running the app in Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xp3Uh6dptg)

## How to run Harmony's Node.js front end.

First you need the [API server](https://github.com/harmonydata/harmonyapi) running. Download, install and start the Harmony API. The Node.js front end will connect to the API server.

Follow the steps to install [Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Then `cd` into this cloned folder (`cd app`) and run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

You can access Harmony in your browser at `http://localhost:3000/app#/`.

## How to run this front end and connect to localhost API

[Watch a video tutorial on how to run the Harmony front end locally and connect to Harmony API on localhost](https://youtu.be/1xp3Uh6dptg?si=g2CkXGEJCtevgdzY)

Run the [Harmony API](https://github.com/harmonydata/harmonyapi) app in Python.

Open `.env` and change `REACT_APP_API_URL` to `http://localhost:8000` and change `REACT_APP_ABSOLUTE_URL_PREFIX` to `http://localhost:8000/app` (so that the front end knows that it's running on localhost and that it should connect to a localhost API)

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
REACT_APP_ABSOLUTE_URL_PREFIX=http://localhost:8000/app
```

Then run `npm install; npm start` as usual.

## Who to contact?

You can contact Harmony team at https://harmonydata.ac.uk/, Thomas Wood at http://fastdatascience.com/ or John Rogers at http://delosis.com

## Deployment

Commits / pull requests to the master or staging branches will trigger an automatic build on netlifiy - temporay build URLS will be displayed in pull requests and please manually confirm your commits are working as intended.

The staging branch is always available at https://harmony-staging.netlify.app/

This app is deployed to the main website using Github actions when there is a push to `releases` branch - this is a protected branch. The script to do this is under folder `.github`.

Ulster University is managing the domain `harmonydata.ac.uk` which is configured to point to the IPs of the Github Pages deployment.
